The data set provides a frequency distribution on income brackets and breaks down average scores by these family income brackets, namely less than 20k, 20-40k, 40-60k, 60-80k, and more than 100k. Additionally, the data set provides average scores as well as a frequency distribution of score ranges grouped by gender. Furthermore, there is some additional context of academic strength in the form of average GPA and average years taken of Arts/Music, English, Foreign Languages, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences, but these will not be utilized as heavily in the tutorial. Instead, we will look to identify correlations by combining the SAT scores from 2007 - 2014 with the CORGIS State Demographics data set. <br /> <br /> The States Demographics data set gives a summarized view of information collected from the United States Census Bureau over the years 2007 - 2014, however the information provided is a condensed and summarized set of data from 2015 broken up between all 50 of the states. The data set differentiates between those whose education ended with a high school degree or above compared to those who have attained a bachelor's degree or above. Employment is classified as farm or non-farm related, and it includes a percent change for the non-farm sector to give context to what areas are urbanizing. Beyond exploring the well-established trend of income vs. average score, we can investigate how much a change from one income bracket to another affects SAT score improvements i.e. are there diminishing returns, or if it affects both verbal and math scores equally. The data set also contains information pertaining to languages spoken in a household, firm ownership/employment, and home ownership, among other things. These miscellaneous points of data can be used to build a profile of the type of environment that creates higher standardized test scores, or how higher test scores can be indicative of higher/lower values in these areas. <br /> <br /> <strong>Questions to Consider for the Combined SAT Scores and State Demographics Data: </strong> <br /> </p>
<ul>
<li>What is the relationship between prevalence of farms and average SAT scores? Does it affect male and female scores in the same way?</li>
<li>Do states with a higher presence of bachelor degrees or higher perform better on the SATs?</li>
<li>Do states with a higher home ownership rate perform better on the SATs?</li>
<li>Do states with a lower person per household ratio perform better on the SATs?</li>
<li>Do states with a higher rate of living stability (i.e. rate of households that have been living in the same house 1+ years) perform better on the SATs?</li>
<li>Do states with a lower average commute time perform better on the SATs?</li>
<li>Do states with a higher rate of languages other than English at home typically see a lower SAT verbal score?</li>
<li>Do states with higher average female scores typically see a higher rate of female-owned firms?</li>
